# AI-Generated Custom Cover Letter Application

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for an AI-powered application designed to generate custom cover letters for job applications. The application leverages Generative AI (Gen-AI) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to produce personalized cover letters based on a user's resume and a specific job description. 

### Key Features
- **Resume and Job Description Analysis**: The user uploads their resume and a job description they are interested in. The application analyzes these documents to understand the user's skills and the requirements of the job.
- **AI-Driven Cover Letter Generation**: Using state-of-the-art open-source Large Language Models (LLMs), the application generates a tailored cover letter highlighting the most relevant experiences and skills.
- **Email Integration**: The generated cover letter can be sent directly to the HR's email provided by the user, simplifying the job application process.
- **Customization and User Feedback**: Users can review, edit, and modify the generated content before sending it, ensuring a high level of customization.

### Technologies Used
- **Gen-AI & LLMs**: Freely available models for text generation.
- **RAG Framework**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation to include relevant details from the resume.
- **Flask** or **FastAPI**: For backend processing.
- **HTML/CSS & JavaScript**: For the user interface.
- **SMTP**: For email handling.

### Objective
The primary goal of this project is to streamline the job application process by automating the creation of high-quality, custom cover letters, enhancing the chances of a successful job application.
